# **To-Do List Application**

## **Overview**

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework. The application provides basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations to manage tasks in a user-friendly interface. It serves as a foundational project to understand how Flask can be used to build and deploy web applications.

---

## **Features**

- Add new tasks to the To-Do list.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- User-friendly web interface styled with CSS.
- Fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (basic styling)
- **Backend:** Python with Flask framework
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Deployment:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

# **What is Docker?**

Docker is a powerful **containerization platform** that allows developers to package their applications and all their dependencies into a single, portable unit called a **container**. Containers ensure that applications run consistently across different environments, eliminating compatibility issues.
